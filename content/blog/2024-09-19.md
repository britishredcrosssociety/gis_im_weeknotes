We started this week with a team day in the office. In the morning, we were joined by a 
colleague from the IFRC GIS team who gave us an update on what he's been working on, 
including local unit mapping.

In the afternoon, we did some team planning, sketching out what we've committed to up
until Christmas. This included: 

* Runnning an online GIS training for colleagues in the MENA, with German Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross, IFRC and HeiGIT
* Running an online SIMS Coordinator training with American Red Cross
* Arranging a Humanitarian Information Analysis training in Abuja with Nigeria Red Cross
* Joining a simulation exercise run by BRC Emergency Response teams in Scotland
* Testing features in ArcGIS Online that we don't currently use, like Hub Premium and ArcGIS Web Tools
 
Some of the team went to the [Geomob](https://thegeomob.com/post/sept-18th-2024-geomoblon-details) 
event in London, where Pete Masters was presenting about Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's work 
mapping slums and other speakers celebrated OSM's 20-year anniversary. 

Behind the scenes, we renewed BRC's subscription to ArcGIS Online and updated the single-sign 
on settings that allow BRC staff to use AGOL through Microsoft's MyApps service without needing 
a separate ESRI login.
