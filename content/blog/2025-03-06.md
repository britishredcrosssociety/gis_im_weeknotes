* We had a team meetup in the London office, which was a good opportunity to catch up on what we're all working on and various BRC internal organisation changes. 

## Metadata in ArcGIS Online 
* We played around with the metadata tools in ArcGIS Online. While they allow adding metadata in a way that complies with the INSPIRE standard, the fields aren't searchable, making it of limited use for us. I does seem like they plan to make extra metadata fields searchable in the future. 
	* As a workaround, we discussed including key metadata in the item's long description for visibility, although this may present other issues

## UK ports and airports data
* A colleague asked about the most appropriate datasets to use for UK airports and ports. We looked into it and recommended: 
	* Ordnance Survey's [OpenMap Local](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-map-local) dataset filtered to the 'functional sites' category
	* ESRI's [World Airports](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/e90996158f0a464189098881379597a6_0/explore) layer (based on [OurAirports](https://ourairports.com/)' crowdsourcing)
	* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

## Overseas territories on GO
* We facilitated a discussion between BRC and the IFRC's GO platform team about how best to enable reporting for [British Overseas Territories](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/uks-relationship-with-its-overseas-territories/), which can't currently report separately from the UK on GO. The GO team provided some options for how reporting could work for overseas territories, and we shared these with BRC's Overseas Branches team to get their views.
