* We wrote some documentation on our method of geocoding addresses of BRC properties using PowerQuery (the previous method relied on lots of manual steps).
* We made final preparations for the Humanitarian Information Analysis Course in Abuja - including finalising content and facilitating travel plans for BRC staff.
* We worked with Canadian Red Cross to prepare for an OpenStreetMap mapathon, which will take place next week with one of BRC's corporate partners.
* We did some analysis on engagement with the Information Management Register community of practice sessions. There were eight sessions in 2024 for members to learn, ask questions and get updates on the register. 
* We've been working with a colleague in the volunteer data team to set up a pipeline so that we can make some form of volunteer data available through ArcGIS Online. For the first stage, we'll pull through minimal data, aggregated to LSOA level. Over time, we'll look at how we can show where volunteers are that meet certain criteria, for example they've completed certain trainings or are listed as deployable.
