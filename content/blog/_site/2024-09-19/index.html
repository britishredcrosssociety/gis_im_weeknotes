<p>We started this week with a team day in the office. In the morning, we were joined by a
colleague from the IFRC GIS team who gave us an update on what he's been working on,
including local unit mapping.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we did some team planning, sketching out what we've committed to up
until Christmas. This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Runnning an online GIS training for colleagues in the MENA, with German Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross, IFRC and HeiGIT</li>
<li>Running an online SIMS Coordinator training with American Red Cross</li>
<li>Arranging a Humanitarian Information Analysis training in Abuja with Nigeria Red Cross</li>
<li>Joining a simulation exercise run by BRC Emergency Response teams in Scotland</li>
<li>Testing features in ArcGIS Online that we don't currently use, like Hub Premium and ArcGIS Web Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the team went to the <a href="https://thegeomob.com/post/sept-18th-2024-geomoblon-details">Geomob</a>
event in London, where Pete Masters was presenting about Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team's work
mapping slums and other speakers celebrated OSM's 20-year anniversary.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, we renewed BRC's subscription to ArcGIS Online and updated the single-sign
on settings that allow BRC staff to use AGOL through Microsoft's MyApps service without needing
a separate ESRI login.</p>
