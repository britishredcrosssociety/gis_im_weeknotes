Up until now, we've updated it using an Excel doc with several sheets linked by XLOOKUPS, which required doing manual looking up of new addresses and pasting the coordinates into one of the sheets to feed a table in another sheet.</p>\n<p>We've now replaced this with a process based on PowerQuery in Excel. We broke the task down into steps and mapped out how to transform the input data so that it matches what we publish on AGOL. Some of the process needed a bit of trial and error, and we used ChatGPT for some troubleshooting.</p>\n<p>The process is now better documented and easier to run when new data is shared with us. We're now exploring doing the geociding directly in PowerQuery and removing the need for an intermediate lookup table.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharing-our-work-internally\" tabindex=\"-1\">Sharing our work internally <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2025-01-09/\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We did a presentation to the International team on how maps and spatial data can be useful in their work.</li>\n<li>We also presented what we work on to our parent team, Transformation &amp; Change. Our work is quite different to what the rest of the team works on, so it was a good chance to show what we do and answer questions.</li>\n<li>We had a meeting on information management systems and Cash programming with the team that works with Red Cross branches in British Overseas Territories .</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"geo-call\" tabindex=\"-1\">Geo Call <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2025-01-09/\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We had a great presentation on this month's Red Cross/Red Crescent Geo call on a project to create street view imagery to support geospatial data workflows. The project was a collaboration between Indonesian Red Cross and American Red Cross, and involved volunteers capturing images from moped-mounted cameras. For the pilot project, the imagery will be used to <a href=\"https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/street-view-green-view/\">assess vegetation</a> to understand climate resilience.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"other-things\" tabindex=\"-1\">Other things <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2025-01-09/\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We had more meetings to plan the Humanitarian Information Analysis Course that we're supporting in March in Abuja. We had to shift the dates slightly so as not to coincide with Eid. The application process is now open to members of our Information Management Register.</li>\n<li>We have a new colleague on the Corporate Partnerships team who will be coordinating Missing Maps activities. We've had some introductory calls with them and will be working with them to support Missing Maps mapathons.</li>\n<li>We've had some good overlap with colleagues working on geospatial analysis for our health services. They are using network analysis to understand access to health facilities, so that BRC teams can better plan services</li>\n<li>We updated some of our internal boundary datasets to reflect reorganisation of some teams</li>\n<li>We shared updates on a piece of analysis for our Crisis Response and Community Resilience teams to get feedback. There were some requests for additional datasets to help them understand the geography of where different teams currently provide services.</li>\n<li>We also had good discussions with colleagues on other data teams to discuss how to manage overlapping requests for analysis. We'll combine our efforts to take advantage of the work each team has alraedy done.</li>\n</ul>\n",

			"content_html": "<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We ran a <a href=\"https://rcrcsims.org/\">SIMS</a> Remote Coordinator training with a colleague from American Red Cross. The training introduced people to the role of the SIMS remote coordinator, including how they work with a deployed IM Coordinator and the wider SIMS network to produce information products for a response.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also ran the final session of the three-week introduction to GIS training with colleagues from MENA region National Societies. We had a good experience and have taken a lot of learnings about using the <a href=\"https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/\">GIS training platform</a> for teaching live classes. Participants' final assignements are due in January, which we're looking forward to seeing!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We published a blog post on the BRC intranet with tips for using maps in communications materials, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding your audience</li>\n<li>Clarity of message</li>\n<li>Using BRC branding</li>\n<li>Representing contested borders/areas</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We made a lookup table to match postcodes to some of one of our service's regional boundaries. We tested out <a href=\"https://duckdb.org/\">DuckDB</a> for reading and processing the postcode dataset, which was significantly faster than using Python's Pandas package. As the lookup table will need to be updated with every quarterly release of the <a href=\"https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/b54177d3d7264cd6ad89e74dd9c1391d/about\">ONS Postcode Directory</a>, we'll look into making a self-service tool for this data in the new year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We did some troubleshooting on an issue with 3D basemaps not showing correctly in an ArcGIS Online Instant App. The issue was caused by projection settings being carried over from a 2D basemap layer. Our 2D basemap layer was projected as British National Grid (EPSG 27700) whereas the 3D basemap <em>should</em> have been in the WGS 84 coordinate reference system (EPSG 4326). We expected that AGOL would treat these as separate layers and manage the transformations between CRSs, but the 3D basemap CRS seems locked to that the 2D layer which made it disabled for adding to a map with layers in other CRSs. Switching to a WGS84 2D base layer allowed 3D basemaps to also be added to the same map.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We gave an overview to a colleague about why counting households in a particular area in the UK is hard, especially if you're restricted to open data. The initial request was to count the numbers of households per postcode across the area where a project is being implemented. We highlighted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Household data is only summarised at the Output Area level, which covers a large area and isn't suitable for detailed local planning</li>\n<li>Openly available address datasets have their drawbacks (e.g. not being able to distinguish residential from business addresses)</li>\n<li>OpenStreetMap data quality is variable (and in the area of interest had poor coverage for residential buidlings)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We read Sam Colchester's great <a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/SColchester/diary/405693\">after-action review</a> on Humanitarian OpenStreetMap's support to Nigerian Red Cross for the response to flooding in Maiduguri in September 2024.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

			"content_html": "<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We joined the information management sessions at the BRC's Nigeria programme quarterly meeting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IM focal points presented the impact of IM - this ranged from moving away from paper-based workflows, to training staff and volunteers in IM, supporting distributions, Excel trainings, the use of Kobo forms for Food Security and Livelihoods, WASH and Health programmes, and being able to respond more effectively (e.g. to provide IM support for the Mpox response).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We supported colleagues in the Communications team to build a StoryMap to show the impact of a Red Cross livelihoods programme in Chad. One of the team has been helping the comms team build the StoryMap and another spent some time digitising river channels from satellite imagery. There is still feedback from technical teams to incorporate, and after it will be published in the new year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>More 2025 planning, this time with the IFRC Surge IM Working Groups</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated a map-based Excel dashboard so that a pivot chart and a map both update based on a single slicer. ArcGIS maps in Excel can use a pivot table as a data source for a map layer, but if the pivot table is filtered the change doesn't reflect on the map. The solution was to create a hidden non-pivot table copy of the contents of the pivot table and use that as the source for the map layer. It's a workaround, but it's good enough for now.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We finished the first version of a geospatial support tool (based on the ESRI Atlas instant app template) and shared it with operational teams. The tool allows users to easily change basemaps, add layers from a pre-selected list (focused on severe weather, operational assets and social vulnerability), and make sketches or measurements on the map canvas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We're half way through a GIS training for National Societies in the MENA region, working with IFRC, German Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross and HeiGIT. We've also been preparing to run a training on the role of SIMS Remote Coordinator with the American Red Cross.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

			"content_html": "<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We had a combined team day and Christmas lunch. We used the morning to review 2024 and look ahead to 2025 and identified some topics to do some more detailed planning on in January. And then had a Christmas lunch, joined by one of our IM Register members who happened to be in town for a few days.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We held the first two sessions of a three-week GIS training for colleagues from National Societies in the Middle East region. The content is being taught from the <a href=\"https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/\">IFRC GIS training platform</a>, and will let us test the content and format some more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of the team went to the Royal Geographic Society's Monday night lecture about the art of <a href=\"https://www.rgs.org/events/upcoming-events/the-art-of-globemaking-inside-the-hidden-world-of-an-ancient-craft\">globe-making</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We did another interview with a user of one of our most-used web apps, to better understand how it's being used and any pain points with the current setup. We'll soon have to rebuild the tool in ESRI's Experience Builder when it <a href=\"https://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/latest/create-apps/wab-retirement.htm\">replaces</a> Web App Builder and want to understand how we can improve it before starting the work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We spoke to colleagues working in Health Information Management about their upcoming work, and had a good introduction to BRC's new Senior Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Resilience adviser. We shared some information about what our team does, particularly around support for Enhanced Vulnerability and Capacity Assessments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We continued planning for the Humanitarian Information Analysis training to be held in Abuja in early 2025, and separately joined a planning session for Nigerian Red Cross' IM activities for 2025.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We had a meeting with colleagues working on a mapping tool in PowerBI to understand the project better and answer their technical questions about ArcGIS Online.

The tool shows the locations of deployed staff, alongside data from Insecurity Insight and IFRC security ratings. The map was built in ArcGIS Experience Builder and has a companion Experience that allows security team staff to update some of the data sources through a form interface.</p>\n<p>We also updated some layers on a prototype Emergency Response map we're working on: creating view layers for flooding, weather, traffic, and internal data that abstract some of the detail; and drafting explanatory metadata so the layers can be used in a self-service way more easily.</p>\n<p>A map of case studies we made with the Community Engagement and Accountability Hub was published on their website. This was also made with Experience Builder and involved some trade-offs between the brief from the team and what's possible in Experience Builder. Some technical details we couldn't iron out, but hopefully we can come back to them as Experience Builder matures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"demos-of-mapping-tools\" tabindex=\"-1\">Demos of mapping tools <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-11-21/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We demoed our Crisis Response mapping product to a colleague to check that it doesn't duplicate functionality being built into a new tool by a different team. The outcome was that we all have a better understanding of what each tool does, and we're happy that the two tools do different things.</p>\n<p>We held the final Python User Group session of 2024 and did a demo of some tools our team has built using Streamlit, such as a postcode geocoding tool (<a href=\"https://postcodelookupapp-yaadvzhrseyhsdhbssw8qh.streamlit.app/\">Streamlit app</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ioalexei/postcode_lookup_streamlit\">GitHub repo</a>), a tool to work with deployment data, and a tool to help understand catchment areas for event venues (<a href=\"https://event-venue-catchment-area-hvjr4scwvaiigvuygshpxt.streamlit.app/\">Streamlit app</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/britishredcrosssociety/event-venue-catchment-area\">GitHub repo</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"licenses\" tabindex=\"-1\">Licenses <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-11-21/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We had conversations about the best way to get ESRI licenses for more people in the organisation (that is, how do we fund licenses beyond what's included in our annual subscription). There is growing demand for people to access and edit internal data, which requires licenses - so we're talking to potential users and budget holders to try to find a solution that works for everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dynamic-data-attachments\" tabindex=\"-1\">Dynamic data attachments <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-11-21/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We spent some time figuring out how to use <a href=\"https://support.kobotoolbox.org/dynamic_data_attachment.html\">dynamic data attachments</a> in <a href=\"https://www.kobotoolbox.org/\">KoboToolbox</a>, with the aim of helping colleagues in one of our partner National Societies use this feature to track indicators across several rounds of household assessments. In theory, this should allow surveyors to pull existing data from previous assessments so they don't need to repeat questions unnecessarily, leading to quicker surveys and less chance for error.</p>\n<p>We found that when allowing dynamic data attachments in the Kobo interface, you are given a warning that this could expose all data saved in the project. After digging deeper, it seems that only the specific fields chosen by the admin get exposed, which is much less of a risk for data protection since sensitive data can be kept hidden.</p>\n",

What started as a conversation about how to update data on a webmap expanded into how services covering different geographies could be easily looked up for a given client location. We talked a bit about possible query interfaces beyond a simple map, and the maintenance burden of building a more complex data structure that might support detailed queries.

We discovered that users without a license assigned can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only add one public featurelayer at a time from ArcGIS Online to a map in Excel</li>\n<li>Add one public webmap to a map in Excel, which can contain multiple layers that someone else has made</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If an unlicensed user adds a public webmap, the feature layers from that map are added to the Excel map as individual layers. If the user then adds another featurelayer to the map, the layers from the public webmap are removed.</p>\n<p>We'll continue looking into what the capabilities are for licensed vs unlicensed users, as it helps us understand what's the best way to support people according to their specific needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"maps-in-sharepoint\" tabindex=\"-1\">Maps in Sharepoint <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-03/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We looked again at options for creating maps from Sharepoint lists. In particular, for geocoding data from a Sharepoint list using PowerAutomate and feeding that into a map on ArcGIS Online. We've prototyped a workflow that takes address data from a sharepoint list and processes it so it will show up in an ArcGIS map component on a Sharepoint site.</p>\n<p>The basic workflow is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add the address as an address data type in a Sharepoint list</li>\n<li>This automatically geocodes to a lat/long coordinate pair in the background</li>\n<li>Use PowerAutomate to split the coordinates into explicit <code>Lat</code> and <code>Long</code> columns</li>\n<li>Use these columns to provide the location for visualisation on the ArcGIS map component for Sharepoint</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"drones-surge\" tabindex=\"-1\">Drones surge <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-03/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>We contributed to a IFRC Surge Awareness seminar on the use of drones/UAVs for emergency response.
