&lt;p&gt;As part of a team goal to enable users to create their own geographic products, we have an internal ArcGIS Hub site that allows users to search, view, download and use geographic data that we hold, and various geo apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have an ArcGIS Hub Basic site, however by upgrading this to Premium it also allows other stakeholders and community members to also join – that may not be part of the Red Cross – which can be useful for emergency response and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to start to focus on creating a Premium site to be ready for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;uk-boundaries-and-data-generalisation&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;UK Boundaries and Data Generalisation &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-10/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started to write a blog detailing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/geographicalproducts/digitalboundaries&quot;&gt;different generalisation levels&lt;/a&gt; of UK boundary datasets provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). We get asked questions about the difference between them and which one to use (e.g., for a webmap, geospatial analysis, in PowerBI). This will hopefully be a good resource to send people to help explain and refer back to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;red-cross-red-cresent-geocall-canadian-red-cross-geo-eligibility&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Red Cross Red Cresent GeoCall: Canadian Red Cross Geo-Eligibility &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-10/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Red Cross presented how they use GIS within a domestic response, and specifically their “geo-eligibility” tool. Eligible people to receive assistance are those that are within the geographic boundary of an impacted area, such as a wildfire evacuation zone, or flood area. This information is then used to provide financial assistance via e-banking. An example of the recent Jasper wildfire was used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;security-map&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Security Map &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-10/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our international department have a security unit that look after British Red Cross staff safety and security. We’ve recently started a project with them to create an ArcGIS Experience, where they are able to edit the security situation and level within a country. This information then is changed on a webmap visible by a wider audience. This week we’ve been adding more countries to this tool which will then be user tested.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Missing Maps job, maps in Excel and Sharepoint, drones surge, maps guidance</title>
		<link href="https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-03/"/>

		<id>https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-03/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;missing-maps-job&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Missing Maps job &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-03/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job that the team was consulted on the job description for is now live:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://careers.redcross.org.uk/vacancies/10471/workshop-facilitator--missing-maps.html&quot;&gt;Missing Maps Workshop facilitator&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location: UK flexible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay: £350-400 day rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract type: Self-employed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closing date: 16 October 2024&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;maps-in-excel&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Maps in Excel &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-03/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked a bit deeper into the possibilities for using ArcGIS Online maps in Excel and Sharepoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Excel, we looked at what&#39;s possible using the ArcGIS Excel plugin as an unlicensed user. We discovered that users without a license assigned can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only add one public featurelayer at a time from ArcGIS Online to a map in Excel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add one public webmap to a map in Excel, which can contain multiple layers that someone else has made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an unlicensed user adds a public webmap, the feature layers from that map are added to the Excel map as individual layers. If the user then adds another featurelayer to the map, the layers from the public webmap are removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll continue looking into what the capabilities are for licensed vs unlicensed users, as it helps us understand what&#39;s the best way to support people according to their specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;maps-in-sharepoint&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Maps in Sharepoint &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-03/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked again at options for creating maps from Sharepoint lists. In particular, for geocoding data from a Sharepoint list using PowerAutomate and feeding that into a map on ArcGIS Online. We&#39;ve prototyped a workflow that takes address data from a sharepoint list and processes it so it will show up in an ArcGIS map component on a Sharepoint site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic workflow is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the address as an address data type in a Sharepoint list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This automatically geocodes to a lat/long coordinate pair in the background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use PowerAutomate to split the coordinates into explicit &lt;code&gt;Lat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Long&lt;/code&gt; columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use these columns to provide the location for visualisation on the ArcGIS map component for Sharepoint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;drones-surge&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Drones surge &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-03/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We contributed to a IFRC Surge Awareness seminar on the use of drones/UAVs for emergency response. Drone teams are now available to request as part of the IFRC surge catalogue, with teams available to deploy from American and Italian Red Cross. The services currently offered are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Media and comms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situational awareness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site surveys
It&#39;s likely that the services offered will expand in the future as more National Societies set up teams capable of offering surge support.
The presentation (prepared by American Red Cross) covered how the surge mechanism works for drone teams, explained the benefits of using drones for emergency response, and gave a brief overview of how drone mapping works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other version of this call, presented by American Red Cross, is available on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFKWu7CRgqk&quot;&gt;IFRC Drones Group YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;maps-guidance-document&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Maps guidance document &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-10-03/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started work on a document on the use of maps as a guide to other teams. It will include things to consider for people making or commissioning maps, such as use of suitable colours, our approved datasets for international boundaries, how to show disputed boundaries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Nigeria IM, drones case studies, conversations</title>
		<link href="https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-09-26/"/>
		<updated>2024-09-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-09-26/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having started writing up team weeknotes last week, on this week&#39;s agenda was
figuring out a good way to share them. I settled on using &lt;a href=&quot;https://11ty.dev&quot;&gt;11ty&lt;/a&gt; to build the site and GitHub pages for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;planning-humanitarian-information-analysis-training&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Planning Humanitarian Information Analysis training &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-09-26/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our ongoing programme of support and capacity building around
information management with Nigerian Red Cross, last week we made progress
on plans to hold a Humanitarian Information Analysis Course training in Abuja early in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIAC is designed to help people &amp;quot;make sense of available information in
humanitarian emergencies&amp;quot;, providing a structural framework to gather and
interpret primary and secondary data. The training helps people make sense of the large variety of information sources they will encounter responding to emergencies, triangulate between data sources to improve accuracy, and identify missing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more info on HIAC is in IFRC&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://surgelearning.ifrc.org/resources/catalog-emergency-trainings&quot;&gt;Catalogue of Emergency Trainings&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had some discussions on 2025 planning with colleagues at Nigerian Red
Cross about some options for the work they&#39;re doing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/digital-and-innovation-at-british-red-cross/branch-level-experiences-in-growing-information-management-at-nigerian-red-cross-56f587abddf2&quot;&gt;develop NRC&#39;s IM
capacity&lt;/a&gt;. We&#39;ll share more when the plans are more concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;drones-case-studies-website&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Drones case studies website &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-09-26/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of our team are supporting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drones.preparecenter.org/&quot;&gt;IFRC Drones Working Group&lt;/a&gt; to develop a
case study resource, where people can look up the details of how drones are
being used in the Red Cross Movement. The work is complementary to American Red Cross&#39;s 2020 report &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanredcross.github.io/rcrc-drones/&quot;&gt;Aid From The Air: An overview of drone use in the RCRC global network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve already done some work identifying possible case studies (researching which references from the report have enough detail to be useful as standalone case studies). This week, we worked on a minisite, also based on 11ty - taking advantage of 11ty&#39;s ability to &lt;a href=&quot;https://florian.ec/blog/eleventy-data-pages/&quot;&gt;create pages from structured data&lt;/a&gt;. An initial test worked well, so we&#39;ll now focus on cleaning up the styling and building out the structure data for the case studies to draw on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the case studies can provide a structure for documenting future activities in a way that&#39;s easy to share with others/learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conversations-with-colleagues&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Conversations with colleagues &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-09-26/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/digital-and-innovation-at-british-red-cross/looking-back-on-150-gis-im-hours-8ef07589fba1&quot;&gt;drop-in session&lt;/a&gt; this week, we discussed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making maps from ArcGIS Online data in Excel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using PowerQuery to consolidate data from multiple Excel documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A broad look at creating a single source of truth for information in emergencies. We spoke a bit about the IFRC&#39;s approach and the recent use of the Data Entry &amp;amp; Exploration Platform (&lt;a href=&quot;https://thedeep.io/&quot;&gt;DEEP&lt;/a&gt;) in the response to Hurricane Beryl in the Caribbean.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we had useful conversations with colleagues in our Insight and Crisis Response teams about options for updating a layer on ArcGIS Online using Python scripts. It&#39;s something our team has been working with for a while and opens up a lot of options for moving beyond manual updates, which limit the number and frequency of updates you can manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a chat to people from the Innovation team about mapping options for
possible work around supporting people affected by floods, and provided
feedback on a job description for another team that overlaps with some of our
work.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Office day, training plans, drop-in debriefs</title>
		<link href="https://britishredcrosssociety.github.io/gis_im_weeknotes/blog/2024-09-19/"/>
		<updated>2024-09-19T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We started this week with a team day in the office. In the morning, we were joined by a
colleague from the IFRC GIS team who gave us an update on what he&#39;s been working on,
including local unit mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, we did some team planning, sketching out what we&#39;ve committed to up
until Christmas. This included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runnning an online GIS training for colleagues in the MENA, with German Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross, IFRC and HeiGIT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running an online SIMS Coordinator training with American Red Cross&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arranging a Humanitarian Information Analysis training in Abuja with Nigeria Red Cross&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joining a simulation exercise run by BRC Emergency Response teams in Scotland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing features in ArcGIS Online that we don&#39;t currently use, like Hub Premium and ArcGIS Web Tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the team went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegeomob.com/post/sept-18th-2024-geomoblon-details&quot;&gt;Geomob&lt;/a&gt;
event in London, where Pete Masters was presenting about Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team&#39;s work
mapping slums and other speakers celebrated OSM&#39;s 20-year anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind the scenes, we renewed BRC&#39;s subscription to ArcGIS Online and updated the single-sign
on settings that allow BRC staff to use AGOL through Microsoft&#39;s MyApps service without needing
a separate ESRI login.&lt;/p&gt;
